### Project Overview

 Aim is topic modelling to find out relevant topics within a particular time frame.
The dataset news headlines sourced from the reputable Australian news source ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corp.) over a period of 15 years and hence includes the entire corpus of articles published by the ABC website in the given time range. With a volume of 200 articles per day and a good focus on international news, we can be fairly certain that every event of significance has been captured here. In total there are 331100 instances of data available with two columns.

The columns in this dataset are:

publish_date: Date of publish of the news headline
headline_text: Headline of the news published on that particular date


### Learnings from the project

 Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, POS tagging etc.
Topic modelling with LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
Use coherence score to determine the optimum number of topics
